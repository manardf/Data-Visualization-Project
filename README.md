# Data-Visualization-Project
This project was created using Seaborn and Matplotlib visuals for Udacity's Data Visualization Project; It consists of 10 different unique visuals across different sections accoridngly.
## About Dataset
The data was downloaded from Udacity in a .csv format; Initially, the shape of the data consisted of more than **180000.000000** rows. 
However, after cleansing the data, and transforming, certain rows were dropped and additional columns were created where the shape of the data consisted of 174952 rows and 31 columns (The columns were a combination of columns in which initially existed in the dataset and additional columns created for the purpose of the analysis).
The rows and columns mentioned show data related to the Ford GoBike sharing-program in which was launched by Ford in partnership and alliance with the company 'Motivate'; The following sharing-program was launched in June, 2017 in the city of San Francisco.
## Project Methodology
The project began by importing essential libraries and loading the Ford GoBike dataset, followed by evaluating the data for missing values and performing necessary cleaning to address any inconsistencies. Preliminary wrangling steps were taken to reshape and filter the data for analysis. 
The exploration started with univariate analysis to examine individual features, followed by bivariate exploration to identify relationships between pairs of variables. Finally, a multivariate analysis was conducted to explore more complex relationships involving gender, user type, and weekday trip patterns. 
The project was concluded with a summary of insights and recommendations based on the findings.
## Project Findings
This project analyzed the Ford GoBike dataset to uncover key insights on user behavior, trip patterns, and demographics. Findings revealed that weekend trips tend to be longer across all age groups, with customers taking longer rides compared to subscribers, who show more consistent, shorter trips throughout the week.
Gender analysis showed that male users take longer trips on weekends, while female users display a more moderate increase. The data also highlighted that users in the other gender category exhibited higher variability in trip duration.
Recommendations were provided based on these findings to enhance service offerings and engagement strategies.
## Project Recommendations
Based on the analysis, several recommendations were made to help Ford GoBike optimize its service.
First, offering weekend promotions for customers could increase ridership, as they tend to take longer trips during weekends.
For subscribers, Ford can introduce commuter-focused plans that cater to their frequent, shorter trips.
Marketing efforts should be targeted at older age groups, particularly on weekends, since they take longer leisure trips.
Lastly, expanding bike availability on weekends and promoting scenic routes will better serve users who take longer trips during that time, enhancing the overall experience.
## Project Presentation
Once the project was concluded, a presentation was created with an aim to story-tell the findings where it initiated with the user types and usage to highlight to viewers the service provided and type of users available in this service.
Next, the interraction of users with the top 10 stations were presented to highlight where the bikes were often picked up from and during what time.
Following that, I highlighted in the presentation the connection between distance and duration to move from where the bikes are picked up to how they are being utilized in terms of time and distance.
Lastly, the presentation was concluded with the demographics of users utilizing these bikes highlighting their patterns.
